1. 毛宁表示，在乌克兰问题上，中国始终秉持客观公正的立场，始终站在和平一边，为推动政治解决乌克兰危机发挥着建设性的作用。我们不袖手旁观，不火上浇油，更不趁机牟利。
"China’s position on Ukraine has been objective and just. We always stand on the side of peace and have played a constructive role in advancing the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. We are never a bystander, and we would never add fuel to the fire, still less exploit the crisis."

2. 毛宁指出，美国是乌克兰危机的始作俑者和最大推手，持续向乌克兰输送重型武器和攻击性武器，不断抬升冲突的长度和烈度。美方不反思自身的所作所为，反而对中方无端猜忌，横加指责。我们不接受这种毫无根据的讹诈，也不会坐视美方无理损害中方企业的合法权益。
"The US is the one who started the Ukraine crisis and the biggest factor fueling it, and has kept sending heavy and assault weapons to Ukraine, which has only prolonged and intensified the conflict. Rather than reflecting on its own acts, the US has been sowing paranoia and pointing fingers at China. We reject such groundless blackmail, and we will not sit by and watch the US harm the lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies."

3. 毛宁强调，如果美方真心希望危机早日结束，真的关心乌克兰人民的生命安全，就应当停止输送武器，发战争财。要以负责任的方式推动局势尽快降温，为当事方和平谈判创造有利的和必要的环境和条件。
"If the US truly wants an early end to the crisis and cares for the lives of the Ukrainian people, then it needs to stop sending weapons and profiteering from the fighting. The US needs to act responsibly by helping the situation deescalate as soon as possible, and create the necessary environment and conditions for peace talks between the parties concerned."
